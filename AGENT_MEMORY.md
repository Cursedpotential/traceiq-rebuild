# TraceIQ Rebuild Memory Router

> _Byline: Codex · GPT-5 · 2026-08-27; parent-boundary refresh 2026-08-29._

- Architecture decisions: `docs/adr/README.md`, then the linked ADR.
- Schema and transformation contracts: `docs/SCHEMA.md`, `db/migrations/`,
  `db/transformations/`, and `docs/transformations/`.
- Current bounded validation: `docs/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`,
  `docs/VALIDATION_REPORT_data.md`, and the relevant `ops/*REPORT.md`.
- UI intent and implementation context: `ui/AGENTS.md`, `ui/BUILD_BRIEF.md`,
  `ui/BUILD_BRIEF_PHASE2.md`, and `ui/README.md`.
- Reporting context: `reports/README.md` and its linked pages.
- Parent checkout reconciliation is resolved in `../REPOSITORY_RECONCILIATION.md`; the outer
  repository intentionally ignores this independent child and remains outside this commit scope.

Local `.claude/`, `.remember/`, `.memsearch/`, and `.serena/` state may be stale or branch-specific.
