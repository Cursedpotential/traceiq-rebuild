title: Data & provenance
---

> _Naming (D-140, 2026-09-05; applied 2026-09-06): this product is **vestigia** (formerly traceIQ / TraceIQ - Latin: footprints, tracks). Working copy: `probata/modules/vestigia/` (directory rename from `modules/traceIQ/` landed 2026-09-06; old name kept as a junction). GitHub repo name unchanged pending its own decision. Canon: `probata/docs/NAMING.md`. Historical text below is left verbatim; both names remain valid in recall stores (D-142)._

Full transparency on where every number comes from. Three layers:

1. **Original export** — preserved locally at
   `data/visit_locations_2023_clustered.original.csv`; private location data is
   intentionally excluded from source control.
   Nine columns per row: `cluster_id`, `lat_med`, `lng_med`, `points`,
   `first_seen`, `last_seen`, `lat`, `lng`, `cluster`.
2. **Enrichment** — `address` (reverse-geocoded from `lat`/`lng` via OpenStreetMap
   Nominatim, one lookup per row) and `group_label` (readable form of `cluster`).
   Nothing from the original export was altered; timestamps were split into a
   naive local part plus their original UTC offset so they can be displayed
   exactly as recorded, with no timezone conversion anywhere.
3. **Derived metrics** — computed in the page queries, never stored:
   `active_days = last_seen date − first_seen date + 1`,
   `visits_per_week = points ÷ (active_days ÷ 7)`,
   `avg_days_between_visits = active_days ÷ points`.

## Complete dataset — every row, every column

The full working table, one row per location, timestamps verbatim. Use the
download button on the table to export it. Click a row for that location's
full-record view.

```sql everything
select
    '/locations/' || cluster_id::int as location_link,
    cluster_id::int as cluster_id,
    lat_med, lng_med,
    visits as points,
    strftime(first_seen, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') || utc_offset_first as first_seen,
    strftime(last_seen, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') || utc_offset_last   as last_seen,
    lat, lng,
    group_id as cluster,
    address,

```sql dictionary

    ('lat_med',     'Original export', 'double',  'Median latitude of the cluster''s member points'),

    ('points',      'Original export', 'integer', 'Count of raw location fixes assigned to the cluster — shown as "visits" throughout'),
    ('first_seen',  'Original export', 'timestamp + offset', 'Earliest fix in the cluster, local time with UTC offset (-05:00 EST / -04:00 EDT)'),
    ('last_seen',   'Original export', 'timestamp + offset', 'Latest fix in the cluster, local time with UTC offset'),
    ('lat',         'Original export', 'double',  'Plotted latitude — identical to lat_med in this export'),

## Known limits

- The clustered export contains **no individual visit timestamps** — only
  first-seen, last-seen, and a count per location. Every per-visit claim beyond
  those three values would be inference, so none is shown. Add the raw
  pre-clustering file as a second source to unlock per-visit drill-downs.
- Addresses are a best-effort nearest-address lookup at the cluster's median
  coordinate; the coordinate is the ground truth, the address is a convenience.
